The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is invalid or incomplete.  For example, if the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc., are missing or incorrect, initialization will fail silently or throw an error that is not immediately obvious.  Another issue is that the database rules might be too restrictive, causing unexpected write or read failures without clear error messages.
